    "description": "My Client First Philosophy:\r\nThere are many qualities and skills that go into being an excellent real estate professional -- integrity, in-depth community and market knowledge, marketing savvy, effective negotiation skills, and a high-quality, professional network -- ALL of which are hallmarks of how I work!\r\n\r\nThat said, in my experience as a Pell City real estate professional, I've also found that providing the very best service is essentially about putting my clients first. This means keeping myself accessible, being a good listener as well as a good communicator, and responding quickly to your needs.\r\n\r\nThis \"client first\" philosophy has always been my approach and it requires me to continually improve my skills and ways of doing business. In addition, I've found that the latest technologies are enabling me to do everything I've always done, only much more quickly and efficiently. They've also helped me to extend the range of services I provide to my clients.\r\n\r\nMy Community Involvement:\r\nI was awarded the esteemed honor of St. Clair REALTOR OF THE YEAR 2010 and 2015. I served as President of the St. Clair Association of Realtors as well. Both of these positions are elected from among my realtor peers, and I am VERY honored to be of service to an organization that I care dearly.\r\n\r\nI am very involved in my job because I truly love what I do! I am a certified Buyer's Representative and thoroughly enjoy helping my clients to find their dream home in the Pell City and surrounding areas. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am also a member of the BPW, Business and Professional Women's Club. I was the Alabama state winner for the Virginia Allen Young Careerist Program for 2008. With this title, I attended the National conference in Atlanta and competed for the National title. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my adult life! I learned so much about myself and met some incredible women from around the country! With the Alabama state title, I was responsible for presenting scholarship awards for our State winners and the winners from my town. It was so wonderful to watch these girls receive money to further their education! Also, I am involved in BPW/Girl Scout's Leadership conference where I hosted 2 workshops; one on Interview Tips/Dress for Success and the other on Writing a Letter to a Congressman. It was such a joy to assist in preparing and educating these young girls for life after high school.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many other organizations that I volunteer to help. I believe, \"Life is about building relationships and helping other people.\" So when you decide that you'd like to buy or sell a home in the Pell City areas, please contact me for expert real estate advice.",

My commitment to this business is to continually increase education, along with building and maintaining valuable relationships with other realtors, vendors and the community in order to best serve you every step of the way. I will listen to exactly what you're looking for in your new home and search only listings and off-market properties which best suit your criteria rather than driving you all over town hoping to find something that will \"fit\". \nI will do a free market analysis on your property, pulling information from online sources. I will also research sales history from your community, comparing homes currently active for sale in order to find your best list price. Your property is most valuable its first day on the market. Let's price it right and sell it quickly! \nI will hire professional photographers to present your home to the market at its best. \nI use a strong, strategic social-media marketing plan, including personal videos showcasing your property. \nI utilize collaboration with other realtors in the area in order to attract the most buyers when selling, and to find exactly what you want when buying. \nYou can expect open communication and total patience during the entire process. \n\nIn addition to my real estate business, my family also owns Southland BBQ Restaurant and Food Truck. As a fun way to celebrate the sale/purchase of your home, I enjoy providing FREE BBQ for 10 people after closing. You can use this to feed neighbors at a housewarming or to \"encourage\" your friends to help you move!\n\nI am a chaplain at Serving You Ministries and it's one of the highlights of my week to pray with people and learn their stories.",

    "description": "About Zac:\n\nTo understand Zacs commitment to his clients and the value he offers individuals and families interested in buying or selling a home, its important to understand his background and interests.\n\nZac Waldrop grew up in Oxford, Alabama with his parents, Wayne and Jane Waldrop and an extended family that he cherishes to this day. As a young man, he had a passion for music, sports, and learning. He always knew he wanted to leave a legacy and help as many people as he could along the way. \n\nAfter graduating from Oxford High School in 2000, Zac was offered a full academic scholarship to Jacksonville State University. During his time at JSU, he decided to pursue his love of music and joined a band based in Auburn, AL. He transferred to Auburn University in the middle of his sophomore year and has since been a die-hard Tiger and fan of Auburn athletics ever since. \n\nHaving earned a Marketing degree from Auburn in 2004, Zac went to work for Alabamas largest heavy equipment company, coordinating their rental department at their Oxford branch. Soon after, he took a position at the companys headquarters in Birmingham as a finance representative and since 2006 has called the Birmingham area home. \n\nHolding multiple positions and responsibilities (including overseeing the legal department and negotiating contracts on behalf of the company), Zac decided to pursue his Masters degree in business from the University of Alabama Birmingham while working full time. He completed his coursework in less than eighteen months and is now a proud Blazer alum as well. In early 2014, after nearly a decade of office work, Zac decoded to pursue a career in real estate, which afforded him the opportunity to establish the legacy he always wanted and help individuals and families through one of the most important times of their lives. He joined Keller Williams Metro South in September of 2014. \n\nSince entering the real estate business, Zac has been responsible for the sale of over 8.5 million dollars in real estate and, more importantly, helped dozens of families along the way. After only his second year, Zac was awarded the Keller Williams Bronze Award for Top Performing Agents and is very active in his office. His many five-star reviews on Zillow indicate that his clients trust and appreciate Zac while considering him a friend and ally outside the realm of real estate. \n\nWhen he isnt selling homes, Zac likes to relax by reading, playing golf, and (of course) playing music. Zac married his wife, Ellas, on April 18, 2015. They have two dogs together: Marley, a twelve-year-old black lab who thinks shes a cat, and Jack, a nine-year-old golden retriever who has no idea he only has three legs.\n\nAbout Keller Williams Realty Metro South:\n\nWe understand that buying or selling a home is more than just a transaction: its a life-changing experience. Thats why our team of highly-seasoned real estate professionals is dedicated to providing exceptional, personalized service for all of our clients. We take great pride in the relationships we build and always work relentlessly on the clients behalf to help them achieve their real estate goals.\n\nOur team of experts represents the best and brightest in the industry, and were always striving to lead the field in research, innovation, and consumer education.

We have since moved to the Birmingham metro area working out of our ERA-KING offices in Homewood and Hoover with  buyers and sellers in Mountain Brook, Vestavia Hills and the  outlying areas including Leeds, Moody, Trussville, Pell City and Lincoln.  \n  To be in this business you need to have a strong work ethic and a gift with working with the public and both of these attributes I believe are what has made me a successful Real Estate Agent.  Im a multi million dollar producing agent and have been awarded ERA's Circle of Honor and Circle of Success award and an \"A\" team Agent with the Cartus Network specializing as a Relocation Agent with the Realogy  Military Rewards Program and Navy Federal. The relocating client has been my passion since I know firsthand the ups and downs of moving into a brand new community and can relate to their concerns and fears and is why this was the perfect fit for me.  My biggest joy and honor thou comes from working with our Military. I take great pride and am blessed and honored to be able to serve them as their Agent for all they have done and sacrificed to serve and protect me. \n\nMy success has also come from having a great husband beside me that cheers me on as we both know what it takes to make it in the real estate industry.   We have worked pretty closely together since 2007 when we started Nettleton Properties LLC and started building spec homes and rental properties.   Our different attributes complement  each other as The Builder and the Realtor since I know what buyers want in todays ever changing market and trends and he knows how to achieve those wants.  I enjoy designing the homes we build from the outside materials all the way through to the lights we hang, and we are  almost always on the same wave length of the feel we want for each turn key house we build.  We started our company  right when the housing market was starting its crash so we had no choice other than to succeed, which we were fortunate to have done.  We are now building more pre sold homes than specs, but we still have our hand in the spec market in the growing communities along I-20 from Oxford to Birmingham. \nAs the Builder and the Realtor team, Our motto is We dont just build houses, were building your Home.    \nWhen you need a REALTOR® to help you through any process of real estate whether it be building, buying or selling a home, I'm here for you and you will see for yourself that I'm the key ingredient that will make your transaction successful, smooth and fun.",

Let's face it, is there anything better than seeing a smile on the face of a family knowing that they have just found their perfect home? \n\nI started my passion for Real Estate when I was 20 years old.   It was about seven years later, when I started selling Real Estate. For me to become a better well rounded agent, I worked in the mortgage business in Birmingham for about four years. I worked in Birmingham in commercial lending for another year after that. Since then I've studied under the nation's premier real estate firms and million dollar agents and I'm proud to define my artisanship under their guidance. \n\nI'd love to work with you and am confident that I can assist you with the buying or selling process. If you would like to schedule a meeting, please call me at 256-510-4625 or email me at kiwilliams@realtysouth.com.

    "description": "Susan Lehman is not just another Realtor. After retiring as a Special Education Teacher, she decided to pursue a career in residential real estate. In 2012, she joined Keller Williams Metro South in Alabaster and quickly became of her agencys top producers. Shortly thereafter, she built a team of industry professionals, Team Lehman, to better assist her customers in the selling and buying processes.\n\nIn Susans first year as a Realtor, she was awarded Rookie of the Year and, in 2017, was invited to serve on Keller Williams Agent Leadership Council, where only the top 5% are invited to serve. \n\nSelling your home is a business which requires in-depth marketing expertise and communication skills. Susans undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Alabama in both Education and Administration have played a key role in her success in that regard.\n\nOver the last four-and-a-half years that Susan has been in real estate, she sold 120 homes, totaling approximately 20,000,000.00 dollars in sales. During the first half of 2017 alone, she sold 31 homes for a total of 5,007,000.00 dollars in sales. As an expert in marketing homes in our local area, Susan provides her clients with a wealth of knowledge and expertise about buying and selling real estate which outside agents simply cannot offer. No market is identical. Therefore, buyers and sellers need a local, professional agent they can trust for up-to-date and relevant information. \n\nHere are some of the things Susan and Team Lehman can do for you:\n\nFind Your Next Home  When you are looking for a new home, you need someone who knows the area inside and out!  Susan and Team Lehman will work with you to find the right home at the right price, including all the neighborhood amenities that matter - not to mention the essential criteria you have for your ideal home.\n\nSell a Home - When it's time to sell, Susan and Team Lehman will advertise your home, show it to prospective buyers, negotiate the purchase contract, help guide you through the financing process, oversee inspections, handle all necessary paperwork, and facilitate the closing. They will take care of everything you need, from list to close.\n\nConsult on Home Selling Tactics  Oftentimes, buyers don't visualize living in your home the same way you do. Susan and Team Lehman will help you make your home attractive to prospective buyers - which can help you get top dollar. Things like staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls can be the difference between a home languishing on the market or selling quickly and for the best price.\n",
